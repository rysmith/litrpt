Project:
Litigation Scripts

Description:
I use these files to track and evaluate document productions produced in the course of litigation.

Procedure:
When a production comes in, I usually run the standard report (report_opt.sh) and then the first page report (opt).  
After that I upload it to the ec2 instance.  
Once the file is loaded in the NSF connected folder (/lanier), I run the tiff to pdf conversion script, calling Swaylaw's Java library.
It is then loaded into Swaylaw's review platform, Compel.
