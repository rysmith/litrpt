Project:
Litigation Scripts - a suite of shell scripts to analyze litigation document productions

Description:
I use these files to track and evaluate document productions produced in the course of litigation.

Procedure:
When a production comes in, I usually run the standard report (report_opt.sh) and then the first page report (opt).
